# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# `npm i`
Run npm i command  to install Node modules

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

`steps to start the application`:
run [npm i] in your terminal to install node_modules
run [npm start]  in your terminal to start the Application


Note : please do not include `[` and `]` while running the commands

after succesfully completing the above steps the application should start on port  3000 on your localhost


`steps to use the App`
1)register as a  new user with a  valid email and password 
2) login with same email and password
3)after login it will redirects the user to add toDo page ,here the user can create a Todo 
3)after creating todo click on view Todo to view  and edit and delete  the created ToDos
5) the user can also sign in with different emails and password,todos are isolated between different users

`Happy TODOing`


`Deployment plan`
Great! Deploying a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack application involves specific considerations for each part of the stack. Here's an adjusted deployment plan specifically tailored for a MERN stack application:

Deployment Plan for MERN Stack Application on AWS
Cloud Service Provider Selection:

Provider: Choose AWS due to its comprehensive service offerings and compatibility with the MERN stack components.
Deployment Strategy:

Containerization: Utilize Docker to containerize the application components for consistent deployment and scalability.
Configuration for Cloud Environment:

AWS Setup: Configure AWS environment settings:
Set up EC2 instances for Node.js backend and React frontend.
Use Amazon S3 for storing static assets like images or files.
Configure AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for load balancing traffic between backend instances.
Securely manage environment variables using AWS Parameter Store or environment-specific configurations.
Database Setup:

MongoDB Atlas: Use MongoDB Atlas for a managed MongoDB instance:
Set up and configure a MongoDB Atlas cluster with appropriate security settings.
Migrate existing MongoDB data to MongoDB Atlas.
Deployment Steps:

Backend Deployment:
Set up Node.js environment on EC2 instances.
Deploy the Express.js backend using Docker containers.
Run the Node.js server with PM2 or Docker.
Frontend Deployment:
Build the React frontend locally.
Serve the static React build files from an S3 bucket or deploy it on another EC2 instance.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

Pipeline Setup: Implement CI/CD using AWS CodePipeline:
Configure CodePipeline to automatically build, test, and deploy changes pushed to the Git repository for both backend and frontend.
Integrate testing stages to ensure quality assurance before deployment.
Monitoring and Scalability:

Monitoring Tools: Use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring:
Set up CloudWatch to monitor application logs, performance metrics, and resource utilization.
Implement alarms and notifications for critical events or performance issues.
Scalability: Leverage AWS Auto Scaling to manage instances based on traffic demands and load.
Backup and Recovery:

Backups: Use MongoDB Atlas automated backups for data backup.
Recovery Plan: Define procedures for restoring from backups in case of data loss or instance failure.
Documentation and Maintenance:

Documentation: Maintain detailed deployment instructions and configurations.
Maintenance: Schedule regular maintenance for updates, patches, and optimizations to ensure the application's performance and security.
Deploying a MERN stack application involves setting up and integrating various services to work together seamlessly. This plan outlines the steps required to deploy each component of the MERN stack on AWS, ensuring a robust and scalable deployment. Adjustments can be made based on specific requirements or preferences regarding tools and services within the AWS ecosystem.
